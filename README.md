# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
The aim is to build a decentralised platform for payments by the public to municipal and sanitation workers.
The moral goal is to prevent small amounts of money being spent on harmful and largely unimportant goods on daily basis ; instead offer the aggregated payment/ tip money at a later time as a lumpsum ; this promotes money being put to good use. Along with it , it also aims to bring the blockchain use case to the grassroot level.
The technical goal is create a seamless platform that is transparent in displaying where the money flows by keeping a central aggregator and the user need only pay the unique wallet address corresponding to the worker.


**Contract deployed on Mumbai at 0xB111DF95Df1ed177917d09265688adFd4FDc364E**
